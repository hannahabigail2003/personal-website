          <strong>Lesson 1: Introduction to Computing</strong> 
          <p><i>(September 09, 2024)</i></p>
          <p>Throughout this lesson, I’ve learned and realized that amid this modern society, everyone uses several forms of computing which greatly benefits the universe as a whole. It covers almost every corner of people’s lives. It takes place through the use of machines such as calculators and computers to process information which greatly influences society and various industries. Indeed, computers are programmable electronic devices that store, retrieve, and process data, and its systems’ a systematic interaction between entities, processes and operations utilizing an electronic device known as the computer. It works together to perform a specific task causing it to be globally demanded. To sum up, it improves and makes the lives of people easier and the fields of education, business, marketing, military, healthcare, and communication are some of its benefactors. </p>

          <strong>Lesson 2: Professions and career in Computing </strong> 
          <p><i>(September 12, 2024)</i></p>
          <p>I’ve learned that computer technologies have become a universal part of modern life as applications are developed everyday to improve the lives and meet the needs of the people. In fact, computer technologies were used in organizations as computers are universal which expand the computer-related careers. Through this, several professions and careers for job seekers, particularly for graduates, have evolved. It is classified into seven categories such as: programming and software development; information systems operation and management; telecommunications and networking; computer science research; web and Internet; graphics and multimedia training and support; and computer industry specialists. Each of which covers a broad range of careers. </p>

          <strong>Lesson 3: Information Processing Cycle</strong> 
          <p><i>(September 26, 2024)</i></p>
          <p>I’ve learned that the information processing cycle is a sequence of events to process information. It includes input, processing, storage and output. These four phases have diverse roles in this cycle and use devices to perform their tasks. In the input stage, typical devices such as keyboards and mice are used to allow the computer to receive data and instructions. In the process stage,the CPU is usually used for computers to apply the instructions to data to produce information, and stored it in storage devices such as external hard drives for future use. And lastly, in the output stage is when the computer sends information to the people in a usable format, usually using an output device, either paper or in the form of display screens such as monitors and phone screens. </p>

          <strong>Lesson 4: Introduction to Computer System</strong> 
          <p><i>(October 07, 2024)</i></p>
          <p>I’ve learned that a computer system is a systematic interaction between entities, processes and operations utilizing an electronic device known as the computer. It is made up of four main components that work together. These are the hardware, software, peopleware, and dataware. Hardware are physical components that make up a computer system. Storage Devices serves as the storage area of data and information.Software is a collection of electronic instructions that programmers write using a programming language. The CPU then processes these instructions to perform specific tasks. Peopleware refers to the individuals who operate or interact with the computer, either to solve problems or to use the information it produces. Dataware consists of basic pieces of information that by themselves have little meaning to humans (words, numbers, images, sounds), but can become useful when processed. </p>

      <h2><strong>Favorite or Challenging Lesson</strong></h2>
      <p>
        The most challenging yet rewarding lesson was <strong>Lesson 2: Professions and Careers in Computing</strong>. 
        This lesson showed me various computer-related career opportunities available in computing, like programming, software development, web design, and networking. It explained how influential computer technologies are, and how it improves people's lives particularly on graduates because of the broad range of careers it gives rise to.
        I liked learning about how these jobs are important in making life better and solving problems in everyday life. This lesson made me interested in learning more about programming and software development as possible career paths.
